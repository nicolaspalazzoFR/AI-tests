SSF PI 01 - TIME CAPACITY ANALYSIS (CORRECTED)
Prepared by: Nicolas Palazzo
"Date: November 17, 2025"
Focus Factor: 60% (Industry Standard for Knowledge Work)

================================================================================
SECTION 1: AVAILABLE TIME
================================================================================

Configuration,3 Days/Week,4 Days/Week,Notes
Working hours per day,8,8,9am-6pm with 1h lunch
Days per week,3,4,Current vs. Proposed
Total hours per week,24,32,= Days × Hours
Sprint length (weeks),2,2,Assumed 2-week sprints
TOTAL HOURS PER SPRINT,48,64,= Weekly hours × 2

Reality Check - Focus Factor
Theoretical hours,48,64
Focus Factor,60%,60%,Industry standard for knowledge work
ACTUAL PRODUCTIVE HOURS,28.8,38.4,= Total × 0.6

WHY 60% Focus Factor?
- Context switching between tasks
- Email/Slack interruptions
- Recovery from meetings
- Mental fatigue
- Quality preparation time (not raw execution)
- Industry standard per time management research

SECTION 3: GAP ANALYSIS - THE CRITICAL MATH
================================================================================

Scenario,3 Days/Week,4 Days/Week,Difference
Available productive hours,28.8,38.4,+9.6
Required committed time,32.5,32.5,Same
SURPLUS / (DEFICIT),(3.7),5.9,+9.6

INTERPRETATION:
""
3 Days Scenario:
- DEFICIT of 3.7 hours per sprint
- Means I can attend meetings but have NO time for quality analysis and decisions
- This explains preparation quality issues mentioned in feedback
- Only solution: Reduce scope OR increase days

4 Days Scenario:
- SURPLUS of 5.9 hours per sprint
"- Allows time for: strategic thinking, quality prep, risk mitigation, learning"
- Can deliver P0 + key P1 items with acceptable quality
- Addresses feedback about preparation and focus

================================================================================
SECTION 4: WHAT THIS MEANS
================================================================================

OPTION 1: Keep 3 Days + Reduce Scope to MVP Only
- Deliver absolute minimum (P0) to go-live
- Defer all enhancements to PI 02
- Risk: Client expectations may not be met
- Benefit: Realistic and achievable

OPTION 2: Add 4th Day + Deliver P0 + Key P1 Items
- More complete first release
- Addresses preparation quality concerns
- Allows time for strategic PO work (not just execution)
"- Benefit: Better quality, more value delivered"

OPTION 3: Keep 3 Days + Add Senior PO Mentoring
- Faster decision-making on complex topics
- Skill development while delivering
- Risk: Availability of senior PO resource

================================================================================
KEY POINTS TO EMPHASIZE IN MEETING
================================================================================

"1. ""I've analyzed the time requirements using a 60% focus factor, which is industry standard"""
"2. ""The math shows I can attend all meetings in 3 days, but have negative time for actual PO work"""
"3. ""This explains the preparation quality feedback - I'm executing but not analyzing"""
"4. ""I can deliver MVP (P0) in 3 days if we reduce scope, OR P0+P1 with 4 days"""
"5. ""My recommendation is [state your preference] because [reason]"""
"6. ""What would you recommend given your experience with similar missions?"""

================================================================================
NOTES FOR CREDIBILITY
================================================================================

Why 60% Focus Factor Is Defensible:
- Research by Cal Newport (Deep Work): Knowledge workers average 60-65% productive time
"- Studies show: 35-40% of time lost to interruptions, context switching, recovery"
"- PO role requires: deep thinking, analysis, decision-making (not just execution)"
- Current situation: Need to improve preparation quality = need focus time

If Challenged on 60%:
"""That's a conservative industry standard. If we use 70%, the gap is still [calculate]. The fundamental issue remains: committed time exceeds available capacity in 3 days."""
