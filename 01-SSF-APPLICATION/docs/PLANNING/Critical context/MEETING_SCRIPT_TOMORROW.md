## 🗣️ THE MEETING SCRIPT

### PART 1: OPENING - Building Trust (Speed of Trust Framework)

**Your Opening:**
"Good morning [Name]. Thank you for making time for our weekly check-in. I want to start by sharing some progress, then discuss some challenges I've identified that I'd like your input on."

**Why This Works:**
- Professional and respectful
- Promises progress AND challenges (balanced)
- Asks for INPUT (collaborative, not demanding)
- Sets positive tone

### PART 2: PROGRESS REPORT - Make Trust Deposits

**What to Say:**
"This week I've accomplished:
- [Insert 2-3 specific completed items - be concrete]
- Prepared for Wednesday's REX presentation on Jira automation and AI user stories
- Analyzed our full scope and dependencies to identify delivery risks"

**Examples of What to Mention (Use Your Real Accomplishments):**
- ✓ "Completed analysis of [specific feature]"
- ✓ "Documented [specific decisions/requirements]"
- ✓ "Prepared materials for Wednesday's knowledge sharing"
- ✓ Even small wins: "Clarified [specific point] with team"

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with value delivered (trust deposit)
- Shows you're working (not making excuses)
- REX shows PAP requirement being met
- Risk analysis shows strategic thinking

### PART 3: CHALLENGE DISCUSSION - Separate People from Problem (Getting to Yes)

**Transition:**
"I also want to discuss some challenges I've identified. During our refinement sessions, we discovered additional requirements that weren't in the original scope. I've mapped out all the tasks needed for delivery."

**Present Your Analysis:**
[Show your task list]

"Based on this analysis, I see potential risks to our delivery timeline and quality. I wanted to get your perspective on how we should approach this."

**Why This Works:**
- NOT about YOU ("I can't handle this")
- IS about THE MISSION ("We discovered scope changes")
- Uses objective criteria (task list data)
- Acknowledges uncertainty (Black Swan: you didn't see this coming)
- Asks for HIS perspective (collaborative)

### PART 4: SOLUTION OPTIONS - Focus on Interests (Getting to Yes)

**Present 3 Options:**

"I see three possible approaches to mitigate these risks:

**Option 1: Scope Adjustment**
- Deliver core functionality in first release
- Phase additional features for later iterations
- Ensures quality and timely delivery
- Manageable within 3 days/week

**Option 2: Time Allocation**
- Request 4th day to handle expanded scope
- Maintain full scope for first release
- Need to demonstrate this workload to my manager

**Option 3: Additional Support**
- Bring in senior PO for specific areas (e.g., [technical domain])
- Mentoring arrangement
- Faster knowledge transfer on complex topics

What would you recommend given your experience with similar missions?"

**Why This Works:**
- Presents OPTIONS not demands (Getting to Yes)
- Makes it collaborative ("What would YOU recommend?")
- Shows strategic PO thinking (scope management)
- Option 1 doesn't require more days (removes his biggest concern)
- Acknowledges your need to "demonstrate workload" (transparency)

### PART 5: ACTIVE LISTENING - Understand His Interests

**After He Responds, Ask:**

"Thank you for that perspective. Can I ask:
- What are your biggest concerns about this mission's delivery?
- What would success look like to you in the next 2 weeks?
- Are there specific areas where you'd like to see more focus from me?"

**Why This Works:**
- Shows you care about HIS perspective
- Gets concrete success criteria
- Opens door for him to share concerns
- Helps you understand what matters most to him

**IF He Mentions "Missing the Basics" Feedback:**

"I'm aware of that feedback, and I take it seriously. Can you help me understand:
- What specific competencies are seen as gaps?
- Can you give me concrete examples?
- What would you recommend I do to address these concerns?"

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges without being defensive
- Seeks specific, actionable feedback
- Shows willingness to improve
- Makes it collaborative

### PART 6: COMMITMENT - Rebuild Trust Through Behavior

**Your Closing:**
"Thank you for this feedback. Here's what I commit to for the next week:
- [Specific deliverable 1] by [date]
- [Specific deliverable 2] by [date]
- Weekly progress update to you each [day]
- Improved preparation for client meetings

I'll send you a brief written summary of our discussion and these commitments."

**Why This Works:**
- Specific commitments (not vague promises)
- Weekly updates = accountability
- Written summary = documentation
- Shows you're taking ownership
