# Workshop Documentation Best Practices
## How to Capture Better Notes & Demonstrate Professional PO Skills

**Created:** November 18, 2025  
**Context:** After your first Gear Management workshop (4/5 ROTI)  
**Purpose:** Improve documentation for tomorrow's 10am follow-up

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU DID WELL TODAY

**Based on your notes, you captured:**
- ✓ Multiple perspectives (Norma, Benoit, Shylesh)
- ✓ Key insights about workflow
- ✓ Important decisions about registration vs. declaration
- ✓ The multi-unit gear nuance
- ✓ Action items with owners

**This shows you were listening and engaged.**

---

## ❌ WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

### Problem 1: Conversational vs. Structured
**Current:** Notes read like a transcript of who said what
**Better:** Organize by decision/topic, not by speaker

**Example:**

**Current Format:**
```
Norma: "Fishers register nets individually..."
Benoit: "Registration is not mandatory..."
Norma: "You can compose gears..."
```

**Better Format:**
```
DECISION: Gear Registration Status
- Registration is optional (convenience feature)
- Departure declaration is mandatory (regulatory)
- Key insight: Fishers compose individual gears for actual fishing

Sources: Benoit (regulatory interpretation), Norma (user workflow)
```

### Problem 2: Decisions Mixed with Discussion
**Current:** Hard to identify what was actually DECIDED vs. what was DISCUSSED

**Better:** Separate sections:
- DECISIONS MADE (clear outcomes)
- KEY INSIGHTS (important info discovered)
- OPEN QUESTIONS (unresolved topics)

### Problem 3: Missing Decision Summary
**Current:** Have to read everything to understand outcomes

**Better:** Executive summary at top:
- 4 key decisions made
- 3 open questions parked
- 1 priority shift identified

### Problem 4: Action Items Incomplete
**Current:** One action in table, others scattered in text

**Better:** ALL actions in one comprehensive table

## 📝 REAL-TIME CAPTURE TECHNIQUES

### During the Workshop:

**1. Use the Decision Template (That You Had Ready)**

Create a simple doc OPEN during meeting:

| Topic | Decision | Rationale | Who Agreed |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|

Type into this AS decisions are made.

**Benefits:**
- Keeps you focused on outcomes
- Visible to participants (shows you're capturing)
- Easy to format later
- Nothing forgotten

**2. Use Color Coding (If Taking Notes)**

- **GREEN:** Confirmed decisions
- **YELLOW:** Open questions  
- **RED:** Blockers/risks
- **BLUE:** Insights/learnings

**Scan your notes later and group by color.**

**3. Capture Exact Quotes for Key Points**

When someone says something important, write EXACTLY:

> "Most of this is declarative. It should not be more complex than this." - Benoit

**Why:** Helps when you need to reference or explain decisions later

**4. Draw Diagrams in Real-Time**

For complex workflows (like the Norma explanation):

```
FISHER WORKFLOW:
Register individual gears → Departure (declare list) → Compose for fishing → Haul (report composed)
```

**Visual capture helps your understanding AND theirs.**

**5. Confirm Understanding Out Loud**

When you hear something complex:

"Let me make sure I understand: [summarize in your words]. Is that correct?"

**Then write down YOUR summary, not their exact words.**

**Benefits:**
- Confirms you understood correctly
- Creates clearer notes
- Shows active listening
- Prevents misunderstandings

## ⏰ TIME MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES (For Tomorrow)

### Issue Today: Topics diverged, agenda lost track

### Solutions for Tomorrow:

**1. Visible Timer**
- Have clock visible
- Announce time at transitions: "We have 25 minutes left, let's move to next topic"

**2. Parking Lot Discipline**

When discussion goes off-track:

"This is valuable, but let me add it to our parking lot so we can complete our core agenda. We can circle back if time permits."

**Practice saying this phrase tonight.**

**3. Topic Time Boxes**

For each topic, SET a time limit and stick to it:

"We have 8 minutes for this topic. Let's focus on the key decision: [X]"

**When time is up:**
"We've reached our time box. Let me capture where we are and move forward. Any remaining points go to parking lot."

**4. Progress Checks**

Every 15 minutes:

"Quick progress check: We've covered [X] and [Y]. We have [Z] and [W] remaining. On track."

**Keeps everyone aware of pacing.**

**5. The "Defer" Technique**

For complex discussions:

"This deserves deeper analysis. Let me note this as a follow-up topic for [tomorrow's workshop / separate discussion]. For today, can we agree on [simpler related decision]?"

---

## 🎯 QUICK COMPREHENSION TECHNIQUES

### Issue Today: Hard time understanding client's complex explanations

### Solutions:

**1. Active Listening with Summarization**

After they explain something complex:

"Let me make sure I have this right: [Repeat in your own simpler words]. Is that accurate?"

**If yes:** You understood, move forward
**If no:** "Can you clarify the part about [X]?"

**2. Visual Confirmation**

Draw a simple diagram:

"Is this what you mean? [Show visual]"

**People often explain better when reacting to a visual.**

**3. Break It Down**

"I want to make sure I understand each part:
- First: [Part A]  
- Then: [Part B]
- Finally: [Part C]

Is that the correct sequence?"

**4. Examples Help**

"Can you give me a concrete example of how a fisher would do this?"

**Specific examples are easier to understand than abstract explanations.**

**5. Don't Fake Understanding**

If you're lost after 2 tries:

"I want to make sure I fully understand this before we decide. Can we take 2 minutes to diagram this together?"

**Better to ask than to nod and be confused.**

## 📊 DECISION DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK

### The 5 Elements Every Decision Needs:

**1. WHAT** was decided (clear, specific statement)
**2. WHY** (rationale, constraints, trade-offs)
**3. WHO** agreed (validation, authority)
**4. IMPACT** (what this affects, implications)
**5. NEXT STEPS** (actions flowing from this decision)

### Example from Today (Improved):

**DECISION: Gear Registration is Optional (Not Mandatory)**

**WHAT:** Fisher can pre-register gears to vessel but is not required to. Mandatory declaration occurs in departure/catch reports.

**WHY:** 
- Regulatory requirements focus on declarations, not pre-registration
- Benoit confirmed most reporting is declarative  
- Simplifies compliance (don't block fishers who don't pre-register)

**WHO:** Confirmed by Benoit (DG MARE technical lead), agreed by all attendees

**IMPACT:**
- Gear registration wizard becomes nice-to-have, not critical path
- May shift PI 01 priorities toward departure/haul reporting
- Simplifies validation logic (no forced gear linkage)

**NEXT STEPS:**
- Discuss priority implications with Mission Manager
- Re-assess PI 01 backlog ranking
- Update user story acceptance criteria

**See the difference?** Clear, structured, actionable.

## 📧 POST-WORKSHOP EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Workshop 1 Summary - Gear Management Requirements

**Body:**

Team,

Thank you for today's productive Gear Management requirements workshop (ROTI: 4/5).

**Key Decisions:**
1. Gear registration is optional; mandatory declaration occurs in departure/catch reports
2. Multi-unit gear: Separate registrations only when characteristics differ
3. Data validation per Gear-Gear file (awaiting from MDR team)

**Important Discovery:**
Departure declaration and haul reporting may be higher priority than gear registration wizard. Recommend discussing priority implications.

**Tomorrow's Workshop (10:00-11:00):**
Complete remaining Gear Management requirements and finalize business rules.

**Confluence:** Updated page available here: [link]

**Action Items:**
- Norma: Send Gear-Gear file (this week)
- Nicolas: Mockup alignment with Shylesh (before tomorrow)
- All: Review Confluence before tomorrow's session

Best regards,
Nicolas
