# Expert Critique: Your Refinement Process Proposal

**Reviewed by:** Expert Product Coach & Product Manager  
**Document:** Your PI 02 Refinement Process Proposal  
**Date:** November 17, 2025

---

## 📊 THE NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP

### Current State:
- **3/35 user stories refined** (8.5% complete)
- **32 stories remaining**
- **Deadline:** End of January 2026
- **Time available:** ~10 weeks (assuming you start now)

### Math Check:
- 32 stories ÷ 10 weeks = **3.2 stories per week minimum**
- Current approach: 3× 1-hour sessions per sprint (2 weeks) = **3 hours per sprint**
- Your success rate so far: **3 stories in ~6 weeks** = 0.5 stories/week

**🚨 PROBLEM:** At current pace, you'll refine 5 stories by January, not 32.

**You need to 6X your refinement velocity. Your proposal doesn't address HOW.**

---

## ❌ CRITICAL WEAKNESSES

### 1. **Vague Process - No Clear Timing**

**What You Wrote:**
"DG MARE BO + BA Meetings to write needs and Business Rules"

**Questions an Expert Would Ask:**
- How long do these meetings take?
- How many meetings per epic?
- Who attends?
- How does this fit into your 3-day/week schedule?
- What if DG MARE isn't available?

**Missing:** Timeline, duration, frequency

### 2. **Passive PO Role**

**What You Wrote:**
"The Dev Team will present the final version of the tickets to DG MARE"

**🚨 RED FLAG:** Why is the Dev Team presenting to the client? **That's the PO's job.**

**Expert Says:**
- PO owns the backlog and client relationship
- Dev team should refine technical implementation, not present to client
- This makes you look like you're delegating your core responsibility
- Mission Manager will see this as avoiding client interaction

**Fix:** "As PO, I will present refined tickets to DG MARE, with dev team available for technical questions"

### 3. **No Definition of "Refined"**

**What You Wrote:**
Pre-requirements list, but no definition of what "refined" means

**Missing:**
- What does a "refined" story include?
- Acceptance criteria defined?
- Technical approach agreed?
- Effort estimated?
- Dependencies identified?
- Definition of Ready checklist?

**Without this, you can't measure success.**

### 4. **Waterfall Disguised as Agile**

**Your Proposed Flow:**
```
1. DG MARE meeting → Write rules
2. Dev team refines after rules done
3. Dev team presents to DG MARE
```

**This is sequential (waterfall), not iterative (agile).**

**Problems:**
- What if rules are wrong? (Discovered in step 3)
- What if dev team finds issues? (Too late to adjust rules)
- What if DG MARE rejects in final presentation? (Back to square 1)
- No feedback loops

**Better:** Shorter cycles with validation gates at each step

### 5. **No Risk Mitigation**

**You had TWO failed refinement sessions.** Your proposal doesn't explain:
- What caused those failures?
- How does new process prevent same failures?
- What happens if new approach also fails?
- What's the backup plan?

**Missing:** Lessons learned from failures

### 6. **Assumes DG MARE Availability**

**Your process depends on:**
- DG MARE availability for BO+BA meetings
- DG MARE availability for final approval meetings
- DG MARE responding to Confluence documentation

**What if they're not available? What if they're slow to respond?**

**Missing:** Mitigation for client delays

### 7. **No Capacity Planning**

**Math problem:**
- You work 3 days/week (potentially 4)
- Each day has meetings, prep, etc.
- How much TIME per week for refinement activities?

**Your proposal doesn't show:**
- Time budget for BO+BA meetings
- Time for writing Confluence docs
- Time for dev team refinement sessions
- Time for DG MARE presentations

**Can you actually do 3.2 stories/week with this process?**

### 8. **Unclear Value Proposition**

**Why is your new approach better than current?**

You don't explain:
- How it's faster
- How it's more effective
- How it prevents the failures you had
- What specific problems it solves

**Missing:** Clear "before vs. after" comparison

---

## ✅ WHAT'S GOOD (Keep These)

1. ✓ **Recognition that current approach isn't working**
2. ✓ **Focus on upfront clarity** (Business Rules first)
3. ✓ **Involvement of Business Owners** (good for requirement clarity)
4. ✓ **Documentation in Confluence** (creates shared understanding)
5. ✓ **Pre-requirements checklist** (shows structure)

**These are solid PO instincts.**

## 🔧 HOW TO MAKE THIS COMPELLING

### Transformation Needed:

**Current:** Describes a process  
**Better:** Explains a PROBLEM → SOLUTION → EXPECTED OUTCOME

### Improved Structure:

```
REFINEMENT PROCESS IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL

## 🎯 SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. **Add Clear Timing**

**❌ Current:**
"DG MARE BO + BA Meetings to write needs and Business Rules"

**✓ Improved:**
"**Step 1: Requirements Elicitation** (2 hours per epic)
- Who: PO + DG MARE BO + BA
- What: Document user needs, business rules, regulations
- Output: Confluence page with requirements
- Timeline: 1 meeting per epic, scheduled [Day/Time]
- Success criteria: Requirements approved by attendees before leaving meeting"

### 2. **Define PO Role Clearly**

**❌ Current:**
"The Dev Team will present the final version"

**✓ Improved:**
"**Step 3: Client Validation** (30 min per epic)
- Who: PO leads, Dev team available for technical questions
- What: PO presents refined stories aligned to business rules
- Output: Client approval or specific feedback
- Success criteria: 90%+ approval rate, clear action items for changes"

### 3. **Add Feedback Loops**

**✓ Add:**
"**Validation Gates:**
- After Step 1: BA/BO sign-off on requirements before dev refinement
- After Step 2: PO reviews technical refinement before client presentation
- After Step 3: Incorporate feedback and track approval rate

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Sprint retrospective: Review refinement effectiveness
- Adjust process if not hitting 3 stories/week target
- Escalate if blocked by client availability"

### 4. **Show the Velocity Math**

**✓ Add:**
"**Capacity Planning:**
- Time per story (full cycle): 4 hours
- Available refinement time per week: 12 hours (per my capacity analysis)
- Expected velocity: 3 stories/week
- To refine 32 stories: 11 weeks
- Buffer for delays: Add 2 weeks
- **Target completion: Mid-February 2026** (with buffer)"

### 5. **Address the Failures**

**✓ Add section:**
"**Lessons from Failed Refinement Sessions:**

**What Went Wrong:**
- Requirements not documented beforehand
- Client surprised by what we presented
- No pre-alignment on business rules
- Stories not technically feasible

**How New Process Prevents This:**
- Step 1 ensures upfront requirement clarity
- Business rules documented before technical work
- Dev team validates feasibility before client sees it
- PO reviews everything before client presentation"

### 6. **Make It Client-Centric**

**❌ Current focus:** Internal process steps

**✓ Better focus:** Client outcomes

"**Value to DG MARE:**
- Clearer requirements upfront (reduces rework)
- Better alignment on business rules (regulatory compliance)
- More prepared presentations (respects their time)
- Faster approval cycles (clear documentation)

**Value to Project:**
- Reduced refinement failures (higher first-time approval rate)
- Faster velocity (from 0.5 to 3+ stories/week)
- Better quality (requirements validated before development)
- Team alignment (shared understanding via Confluence)"

## 🎭 HOW TO PRESENT THIS IN THE MEETING

### Don't Say:
❌ "I want to change our refinement process"

### Say Instead:
✓ "I've analyzed why our refinement sessions failed and propose an improvement that should increase our velocity from 0.5 to 3+ stories per week while improving quality."

### Structure:
1. **Problem:** "We're at 3/35 stories, need 3.2/week to hit deadline"
2. **Root cause:** "Failed sessions showed we need upfront requirement clarity"
3. **Solution:** "3-step process with validation gates" [Brief description]
4. **Expected outcome:** "3+ stories/week, 90%+ approval rate"
5. **Request:** "Can we pilot this approach with 2 epics and evaluate?"

**Time to present: 2 minutes max**

## 🚨 CHALLENGES AN EXPERT WOULD RAISE

### Challenge 1: "This sounds like more meetings, not fewer"

**Your Response:**
"Actually, it front-loads work to prevent rework. Failed refinements waste everyone's time. This invests upfront to avoid multiple rounds of revisions."

### Challenge 2: "Dev team doesn't have time for this"

**Your Response:**
"That's fair. The critical path is getting business rules clear. Dev refinement can happen asynchronously. I can adjust the cadence based on team capacity."

### Challenge 3: "What if DG MARE isn't available?"

**Your Response:**
"I've identified this as a risk. Mitigation: Pre-schedule recurring slots with them, work through business analysis proxy when needed, have async approval process via Confluence."

### Challenge 4: "How do you know this will work better?"

**Your Response:**
"I'm proposing a 2-week pilot with 2 epics. If we don't see improvement in velocity and approval rate, we adjust. Gate decision: If not working by week 2, we escalate and explore alternatives."

## 💡 SUGGESTED REWRITE

**Title:** Refinement Process Improvement - Addressing PI 02 Velocity Challenge

**Context:**
- Current: 3/35 stories refined, 0.5 stories/week velocity
- Needed: 32 stories by end January, 3.2 stories/week minimum
- Root cause of failures: Insufficient upfront requirement clarity

**Proposed 3-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Requirements Workshop** (2h per epic, weekly)
- PO facilitates with DG MARE BO + BA
- Document: User needs, business rules, regulations
- Output: Confluence page signed-off by business
- Timeline: Recurring Monday slot

**Step 2: Technical Refinement** (2h per epic, async or session)
- Dev team refines implementation approach
- PO reviews for alignment with business rules
- Output: Refined stories with acceptance criteria
- Timeline: Mid-week completion

**Step 3: Client Validation** (30min per epic, weekly)
- PO presents refined stories to DG MARE
- Quick approval or specific feedback
- Output: Approved stories or clear change requests
- Timeline: Friday slot

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Velocity: 3+ stories/week (6x improvement)
- Quality: 90%+ first-time approval rate
- Reduced: Meeting time (focused sessions vs. lengthy failed refinements)

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- Risk: DG MARE availability → Pre-booked recurring slots
- Risk: Process takes longer → 2-week pilot with evaluation gate
- Risk: Dev team capacity → Adjust cadence, prioritize critical epics

**Next Steps:**
- Pilot with 2 epics (Gear Management, Login)
- Evaluate after 2 weeks
- Adjust or scale based on results

**Request:** Approval to pilot this approach

**Your current version: 3/11 ❌**
**Needs: 11/11 ✓**

---

## 🎯 THE CORE MESSAGE

**Current version says:** "I want to change the process"

**Better version says:** "I've identified why we're failing (0.5 stories/week vs. needed 3.2/week), analyzed root causes, and propose a solution with measurable targets. Can we pilot it?"

**This shows:**
- ✓ Problem identification
- ✓ Root cause analysis  
- ✓ Solution design
- ✓ Risk management
- ✓ Metrics-driven thinking
- ✓ Pilot-and-learn approach

**This is strategic PO leadership.**

## ⚡ QUICK FIXES FOR YOUR MEETING TODAY

### Minimum Viable Improvement:

If you only have 10 minutes, add this to your proposal:

**"REFINEMENT VELOCITY CHALLENGE:**
- Current: 3/35 stories (0.5/week) 
- Needed: 32 stories by January (3.2/week)
- Gap: 6x improvement required

**PROPOSED SOLUTION:**
New 3-step process with upfront business rules reduces failed sessions.

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:**
3+ stories/week through clearer requirements.

**REQUEST:**
Pilot with 2 epics, evaluate after 2 weeks."

**That's it. 4 bullets that show strategic thinking.**

---

## 💭 WHAT AN EXPERT WOULD THINK

**Reading your current version:**
- "Process steps are described, but not quantified"
- "No clear timeline"
- "Dev team presenting to client? That's not right"
- "How does this get them from 0.5 to 3.2 stories/week?"
- "No metrics for success"
- "What if this doesn't work?"
- "Sounds like they're still figuring it out"

**Reading an improved version:**
- "Clear problem identification"
- "Root cause analysis done"
- "Specific, measurable solution"
- "Risk mitigation included"
- "Pilot approach shows good judgment"
- "PO is owning the process"
- "This might actually work"

---

## 🔥 THE BRUTAL TRUTH

**Your current refinement proposal, like your original task list, shows effort but not strategic thinking.**

**It reads as:** "Here's a process I want to try"

**Should read as:** "Here's the problem (velocity), here's why it's happening (root cause), here's my solution with targets (measurable), here's how we'll know if it works (metrics), here's what we'll do if it doesn't (risk mitigation)"

**The difference:** First shows activity, second shows leadership.

---

## 💪 IF YOU USE THIS IN THE MEETING

**When to bring it up:**
- After discussing workload/capacity
- If he asks "How will you improve?"
- As part of your improvement plan

**How to present:**
"I've also analyzed our refinement velocity. We're at 3/35 stories but need 3.2 per week to hit deadline. I've identified root causes from our failed sessions and propose a structured process with measurable targets. Can I walk you through it quickly?"

**Then:** Show the improved 4-bullet version above (30 seconds)

**Don't:** Get into detailed process steps unless he asks

---

## ⏰ YOU HAVE LIMITED TIME

**Priority for today's meeting:**
1. **Time analysis** (proves you need 4th day OR scope reduction)
2. **Progress update** (shows you're working)
3. **Your recommendation** (shows decision-making)

**Lower priority:**
4. Refinement process improvement (only if time permits)

**Why:** Don't overwhelm him with too many topics. Focus on the immediate issue (capacity/scope) first.

## SUMMARY: THE IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

| Current | Improved |
|---------|----------|
| Process description | Problem → Solution → Outcome |
| Vague timing | Specific hours per step |
| Dev team presents | PO presents (owns client relationship) |
| No metrics | Clear velocity and quality targets |
| No root cause | Explains why failures happened |
| No risks | Identifies risks with mitigation |
| No pilot | 2-week pilot with evaluation gate |
| Waterfall flow | Iterative with validation gates |
| Activity focus | Business outcome focus |

**Bottom line:** Good foundation, needs strategic framing and quantification.

**Want me to create the improved version for you?** (Need Act mode toggle)
