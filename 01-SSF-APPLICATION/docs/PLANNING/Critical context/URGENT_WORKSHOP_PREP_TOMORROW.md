# URGENT: Requirements Workshop Preparation
## Tomorrow 2pm - Your Evaluation Moment

**Date:** November 17, 2025 (Preparing tonight)  
**Workshop:** Tomorrow (Nov 18) at 14:00  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Topic:** Gear Characteristics Requirements  
**Attendees:** DG MARE (BO + BA + PM) vs. YOU (alone)  
**Stakes:** Mission Manager evaluating you based on this workshop  
**Prep Time Available:** ~20 hours (realistically 3-4 hours work tonight)

---

## 🚨 THE REALITY CHECK

**After today's meeting, Mission Manager said:**
- "3 days should be enough"
- "Catching up on mistakes is on you"  
- "Be in charge, engage as expert product manager"
- **He's evaluating you based on tomorrow's workshop performance**

**Translation:** Tomorrow is a test. He'll judge whether you can "be in charge" and "act like an expert."

**What's at stake:** Your future on this mission (and possibly at Accenture given 2 failed PAPs)

## 🎯 WHAT "EXPERT PM IN CHARGE" LOOKS LIKE

### What He Wants to See:

**LEAD** (don't follow)
- You drive the agenda
- You ask the questions
- You synthesize what you hear
- You make recommendations

**DECIDE** (don't just facilitate)
- Propose solutions
- Make calls on scope/priority
- Say "here's what I recommend and why"
- Get client to react to YOUR proposals

**KNOW** (don't discover)
- Understand the regulations
- Reference them confidently
- Show you've analyzed the problem
- Demonstrate domain knowledge

**DOCUMENT** (don't just discuss)
- Capture decisions in real-time
- Confirm understanding before moving on
- Create artifacts (Confluence immediately after)
- Follow up with clear summary

### What He DOESN'T Want to See:

**PASSIVE BEHAVIORS:**
- ❌ "What do you think we should do?"
- ❌ Taking notes without driving conversation
- ❌ Letting client set agenda
- ❌ Ending without clear decisions
- ❌ Asking permission for everything

**UNCERTAIN BEHAVIORS:**
- ❌ "I'm not sure but..."
- ❌ Backing down when challenged
- ❌ Excessive hedging ("maybe," "perhaps," "possibly")
- ❌ Looking to others for answers
- ❌ Apologizing for having opinions

## ⏰ TONIGHT'S PREP PLAN (3-4 Hours)

### HOUR 1: Core Content Mastery (6:00-7:00 PM)

**Objective:** Know the gear characteristics topic cold

**Tasks:**
1. **Review regulations** (30 min)
   - Read relevant sections about gear characteristics
   - Note 3-5 key regulatory requirements
   - Understand what's mandatory vs. optional
   - Write down 2-3 "as per regulation X..." references

2. **Analyze your gear characteristics file** (20 min)
   - What are the main characteristic groups?
   - Which are critical for compliance?
   - Which are complex/ambiguous?
   - What decisions need to be made?

3. **Identify the 3-5 key questions** (10 min)
   - What MUST be decided tomorrow?
   - What can be deferred?
   - Where do you need client input?
   - Where can you make recommendations?

**Output:** You can speak confidently about gear characteristics for 10 minutes without notes

### HOUR 2: Prepare Your Recommendations (7:00-8:00 PM)

**Objective:** Have 3-5 concrete proposals ready

**Don't go into the meeting asking "what should we do?"**  
**Go in saying "here's what I recommend and why"**

**Create 3-5 recommendation statements:**

**Template:**
```
TOPIC: [Characteristic group/issue]
RECOMMENDATION: [Your proposed approach]
RATIONALE: [Why - reference regulation, user need, or technical constraint]
ALTERNATIVES: [Other options considered]
DECISION NEEDED: [What you need from client]
```

**Example:**
```
TOPIC: Partial Gear Usage Tracking
RECOMMENDATION: Defer to PI 02 - focus on whole gear registration for PI 01
RATIONALE: Per Regulation [X], whole gear tracking is mandatory. Partial tracking is enhancement. PI 01 scope is already extensive.
ALTERNATIVES: Implement in PI 01 (adds 2 weeks), or never (lose granularity)
DECISION NEEDED: Does DG MARE accept phased approach for this feature?
```

**Prepare 3-5 of these based on your gear characteristics topics**

### HOUR 3: Workshop Structure & Confidence (8:00-9:00 PM)

**Objective:** Create your workshop agenda and practice assertive communication

**Part A: Create 1-Page Workshop Agenda (20 min)**

## ⚠️ WHAT WENT WRONG TODAY (Learn From It)

### The Meeting Management Issues:

**Problem 1: Lost Focus**
You said: "I managed time badly and lost focus"

**Root cause:** Probably tried to cover too much, got defensive when challenged, lost your structure

**Fix for tomorrow:** 
- Stick to your agenda (have it printed)
- If you start to wander, look at agenda
- Limit each topic to ~7 minutes
- Move on even if not perfect

**Problem 2: Doubted When Challenged**
You said: "I doubted when I was challenged by him"

**Root cause:** Weren't confident enough in your analysis, or weren't prepared for pushback

**Fix for tomorrow:**
- EXPECT to be challenged (it's normal)
- Have your rationale ready (regulation X says, user need Y requires)
- Practice not caving (pause, restate with more detail)
- Remember: Recommendations can be discussed and adjusted - that's collaboration

**Problem 3: Presentation Skills**
You said: "I lacked presentation skills"

**Root cause:** Probably went into too much detail, or didn't structure clearly

**Fix for tomorrow:**
- Use the 3-part structure: Context → Recommendations → Discussion
- Keep opening under 15 minutes (watch clock)
- Use visuals (mockups, not just talking)
- Summarize frequently

---

## 🎯 THE ONE BEHAVIOR THAT WILL SAVE YOU

**"CONFIDENT FACILITATION"**

**What this looks like:**
- You start the meeting (don't wait for them)
- You present your analysis first (set the frame)
- You make recommendations (have an opinion)
- You ask for their input (but you led first)
- You synthesize what you hear (show you're listening)
- You confirm decisions (lock them in)
- You document (create artifacts)
- You close with next steps (show forward motion)

**Even if your recommendations aren't perfect, this BEHAVIOR shows "expert in charge."**

**Practice this flow tonight. Visualize yourself doing this confidently.**

## 💭 THE MENTAL GAME

**You're feeling:**
- Defeated (today went badly)
- Pressured (evaluation tomorrow)
- Uncertain (doubting your abilities)

**Reframe:**
- Today was practice (you learned what not to do)
- Tomorrow is opportunity (to show what you can do)
- Uncertainty is normal (you're learning complex domain)

**Remember:**
- The client doesn't know about your performance issues
- To them, you're just the PO
- You can have a fresh start in this workshop
- One good workshop won't fix everything, but it's a step

**Mantra for tomorrow:**
"I am the Product Owner. I've prepared. I have recommendations. I will lead this workshop confidently."

2. Open the regulations
3. Set a 30-minute timer
